pppconfig (2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove all trailing newlines from secrets file, add one
    ahead of new entry, and add a trailing newline.
  * Closes: #153436 pppconfig: adds non carriage return
    terminated lines into /etc/ppp/pap-secrets
  * Rewrote dialogbox() to use pipe/fork/exec instead of backtics.
    This allowed me to remove all the quoting intended to protect
    strings against the shell.  This will make quoting and escaping
    chat and pppd special characters much easier.
  * Changed some regexps to eq's in secrets_file() /get/ section.
  * Closes: #170494 "dummy user\" crashes pppconfig
    Fixed 0dns-up to stop looking for USEPEERDNS as pppd apparently
    no longer exports it.  Fixes several informally reported bugs.
  * Added code to handle MS_DNS variables to used by ipppd to pass
    nameservers to 0dns-up.
  * Closes: #129871 Use MS DNS does not work if using ipppd
