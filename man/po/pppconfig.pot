"B<pppconfig> is a B<dialog> based interactive, menu driven utility to help "
"automate setting up a dial out ppp connection.  It provides extensive "
"explanations at each step.  pppconfig supports PAP, CHAP, and chat methods "
"of authentication.  It uses the standard ppp configuration files and sets "
"ppp up so that the standard pon and poff commands can be used to control "
"ppp.  Some features supported by pppconfig are:"

"Before running pppconfig you should know what sort of authentication your "
"isp requires, the username and password that they want you to use, and the "
"phone number.  If they require you to use chat authentication, you will also "
"need to know the login and password prompts and any other prompts and "
"responses required for login.  If you can't get this information from your "
"isp you could try dialing in with minicom and working through the procedure "
"until you get the garbage that indicates that ppp has started on the other "
"end."
